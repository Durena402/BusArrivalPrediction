CS 439 : Data Science Course Project Guidelines

General Instruction
The purpose of this project is for you to pose a question on some subject, find data to
answer that question, and answer it using data science techniques. The nature of the
data and the subject are deliberately open-ended – the process and analysis are what is
being emphasized and what is graded. I encourage you to pick a problem you are
excited about and will be flexible if the project is relevant to topics and research papers
in lectures. A project can be done individually (not recommended) or by a group of max
3 students (recommended, but no more than 3).

Group Formation and Submit the Project Topic You can form a project group (of max 3 people) and decide/submit the project topic by
Nov 13th

Project Guidelines:
Formulate a question you would like an answer, or a problem you would like to solve, in
a subject you are interested in. Then, find a dataset that you think can help you answer
this question or solve that problem. A few basic kinds of projects are as follows:
1.​ Unsupervised learning project: This kind of project is based on answering
open-ended questions about a dataset. Do data exploration, draw conclusions
about what features of the dataset matter and what don’t, note surprising
features of the data, and visualize lots of things to make these conclusions
legible. These projects will be graded on your correct implementation and use of
the statistical techniques you learned, as well as how clearly your visuals convey
insights about your data
2.​ Supervised learning project: This kind of project is built around producing a
predictive model that solves some problem, using the data set as an input. Use
data exploration and visualization to make decisions about what kind of model to
use, and then train a supervised model on your data. These projects are graded
on your correct implementation and use of machine learning techniques, as well
as the performance of the model you trained.

3.​ Other: If there is a specific project you would like to do that doesn’t fall into either
of the other categories, ask and we’ll be happy to discuss it with you.
For all projects, discuss shortcomings of your methods and provide suggestions for
improving your analysis. Issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data, and
appropriateness of the statistical analysis should be discussed here.
Extra Notes:
- Start Early: Start thinking about your project early and spend enough time developing
it.

Deliverables
1. Project Proposal
Due: 23:59pm, Feb 25th, 2025 (encouraged to submit early)
Purpose: The written proposal should define your project/research question and explain
what you are planning to do.
Length: 2 pages (no more than 3), typed, single-space.
Your proposal should have the following sections, each of which answers a number of
questions about the project

Introduction:

​

For supervised learning projects:
What problem are you solving?
How do you plan to solve it?
For unsupervised learning projects:
What question are you trying to answer
How do you plan to answer it?
How does this approach relate to the lectures/papers we discussed?

Motivation:
Why is your project important? Why are you excited about it?
What are some existing questions in the area?
Are there any prior related works? Provide a brief summary.

Method:
What dataset do you plan to use?
What form does this data have? Is it images, raw text, tabular, etc? What are the
features?
For unsupervised learning projects:
​

What analysis do you plan to do?
How do you plan to visualize your results?

For supervised learning projects:
What kind of model do you plan to use?
How will this model’s predictions help you solve the problem?
Why do you expect this to work better than existing methods?
What would be your implementation steps? How will you evaluate your method?
How will you test and measure success?

Discussion:
What outcome do you expect from your results?
Are there any potential problems you foresee with your approach? What
assumptions are you making about the problem?

2. Final Report
Due: 23:59pm, May 8th, 2025
Length: Normally, a well-explained project would take 6-8 pages, typed, single-space.

Introduction:
​

For supervised learning projects:
What problem are you solving?
How do you plan to solve it?
For unsupervised learning projects:
What question are you trying to answer
How do you plan to answer it?

How does this approach relate to the lectures/papers we discussed?

Motivation:
Why is your project important? Why are you excited about it?
What are some existing questions in the area?
Are there any prior related works? Provide a brief summary.

Method:
What dataset did you use?
What form does this data have? Is it images, raw text, tabular, etc? What are the
features?
For unsupervised learning projects:
​

What analysis did you do?

For supervised learning projects:
What kind of model did you use?
How did you define the problem/feature space?
What would be your implementation steps? How will you evaluate your method?
How will you test and measure success?

Results:
For unsupervised learning projects:
​

What results did your analysis show? Visualize them if possible

​
What new questions do these results raise, and how can they be
addressed by further analysis?
​

Repeat as necessary

​

For supervised learning projects:

​

​

How did you model perform?

​
​
Analyze important performance metrics such as accuracy, recall, false
positive/false negative, MSE, etc as appropriate
​

​

How does this method compare to existing methods?

​

​

Visualize your results

Discussion:
What outcome did you expect from your results?
How did your actual results differ from your expected results?

If your final report differs from your proposed project, discuss the differences,
why you made certain changes, and the bottlenecks that prevented you from
proceeding with the proposed project.

3. Code submission
Due: 23:59pm, May 8th, 2025, with the final submission
Your code should be submitted as a single Jupyter notebook. The code should open
your dataset, perform any analyses you use in your paper, and produce all
visualizations. Your final submission should do all of these in a single run, so that I can
see all your results from running your notebook once.
Note to all: You may use tools to help with your writing but do not use generated
contents directly. Please cite any tools, web sources, papers, and textbooks you
consult/use. You are responsible for the content of your writing, including its originality
and correctness. Plagiarism is not allowed.
