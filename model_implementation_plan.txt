# Bus Arrival Time Prediction: Model Implementation Plan

This document outlines the detailed implementation steps for developing and comparing different machine learning models for bus arrival time prediction.

## 1. Data Preparation

### Feature Engineering
- **Temporal Features**:
  - Extract hour of day, day of week, month
  - Create cyclical encoding of time features (sin/cos transformations)
  - Flag for rush hours (7-9am, 4-7pm)
  - Flag for weekends/weekdays

- **Distance Features**:
  - Calculate normalized distance to next stop
  - Create distance-to-destination feature

- **Weather and Traffic Features**:
  - One-hot encode weather conditions (Clear, Rain, Snow, etc.)
  - One-hot encode traffic conditions (Light, Moderate, Heavy, Gridlock)
  - Create binary flags for weather events

- **Historical Features**:
  - Create lag features for previous stop delays
  - Calculate rolling averages of delays for each route
  - Create features for cumulative delay on a trip

### Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values**:
  - Identify and handle any missing data
  - Apply appropriate imputation strategies if needed

- **Feature Scaling**:
  - Standardize numerical features (zero mean, unit variance)

- **Data Splitting**:
  - Training set (70%)
  - Validation set (15%)
  - Test set (15%)
  - Ensure proper temporal splitting (earlier data for training, later for testing)

## 2. Models

### Linear Regression
- **Implementation**:
  - Use scikit-learn's LinearRegression
  - Train on both raw features and engineered features
  - Document coefficient values and interpretations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
  - Explore regularization (Ridge, Lasso) if needed
  - Use cross-validation for hyperparameter selection

### Random Forest
- **Implementation**:
  - Use scikit-learn's RandomForestRegressor
  - Train with default parameters first

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
  - Optimize n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split
  - Use RandomizedSearchCV or GridSearchCV for tuning
  - Document optimal parameters

- **Feature Importance Analysis**:
  - Extract and visualize feature importance
  - Identify top predictors of bus arrival times/delays

## 3. Model Evaluation

### Metrics
- **Primary Metrics**:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

- **Secondary Metrics**:
  - R-squared (R²)
  - Prediction within X minutes (accuracy at different thresholds)

### Comparative Analysis
- **Performance Comparison**:
  - Create tables comparing both models across all metrics
  - Calculate statistical significance of differences

- **Efficiency Analysis**:
  - Training time
  - Inference time
  - Model size

- **Context-Specific Performance**:
  - Performance during weather events
  - Performance during rush hours vs. non-rush hours
  - Performance on routes with frequent detours

## 4. Visualization and Interpretation

### Performance Visualization
- **Time Series Plots**:
  - Actual vs. predicted arrival times
  - Error distribution over time of day
  - Error distribution by route

- **Feature Importance**:
  - Compare important features across models

### Model Interpretation
- **SHAP Values Analysis**:
  - Implement SHAP for Random Forest interpretation
  - Compare with Linear Regression coefficients

- **Error Analysis**:
  - Identify common patterns in prediction errors
  - Analyze worst-performing scenarios

## 5. Documentation and Reporting

- **Methodology Documentation**:
  - Document all data preprocessing steps
  - Document model architectures and parameters
  - Explain rationale for modeling choices

- **Results Reporting**:
  - Create concise summary of key findings
  - Generate tables and charts for final report
  - Formulate conclusions about model suitability

- **Future Improvements**:
  - Identify limitations of current approach
  - Suggest refinements to models
  - Propose additional data sources that could improve predictions
