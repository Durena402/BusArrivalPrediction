#### 1. When to log

* Any new idea, hypothesis, or research question raised
* Start or completion of an implementation task or experiment
* Quantitative results (metrics, plots, confusion‑matrices, etc.)
* Bugs, dead‑ends, or other failures and how they were resolved (or why they were abandoned)
* Decisions & their rationales (e.g. “switched from XGBoost ➜ LSTM because …”)

#### 2. Entry format (append to **project-timeline.txt**)

```text
YYYY‑MM‑DD | <Phase> | <Brief summary> | Outcome:<Success|Failure|Partial>
Details: <1‑3 sentences capturing WHAT/WHY/HOW>
Next‑steps: <short action plan>
```

*Phase* suggestions: Ideation, Data‑Prep, Modeling, Training, Evaluation, Fix, Refactor, Deployment, Documentation.

If additional context (tables, longer notes, code snippets) is useful, include it beneath the header line in fenced code blocks.

#### 3. Professor‑facing checklist

Each log entry should map (explicitly or implicitly) to the sections the professor expects in the research paper:

* **Introduction / Motivation** – problem statement, connection to lecture papers
* **Dataset / Features** – source, modality (images, text, tabular …), preprocessing
* **Method** – model/analysis type, feature space definition, evaluation plan
* **Results** – metrics (accuracy, recall, MSE…), visualisations, comparisons
* **Discussion** – interpretation of results vs. expectations, new questions raised

#### 4. Destination & file‑handling rules

* **Always append** to `project-timeline.txt`; never overwrite previous content.
* Create the file if it does not yet exist.
* Store as UTF‑8 plain text in the project root so it can be easily imported into LaTeX/Markdown later.

#### 5. Example entry

```text
2025‑05‑06 | Modeling | Switched from linear regression to Random‑Forest | Outcome: Success
Details: CV‑RMSE dropped from 12.4 ➜ 7.8 on syntheticDataset.csv. See notebook run_2025‑05‑06.ipynb for plots.
Next‑steps: Grid‑search n_estimators & max_depth; evaluate on merged weather+bus data.
```
