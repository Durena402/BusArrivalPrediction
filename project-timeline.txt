2024-06-11 | Ideation | Switched to synthetic dataset due to time constraints | Outcome: Success
Details: Decided to use a synthetic dataset to simulate bus, weather, and event data, as real data collection was not feasible within the project timeline. This allows us to proceed with modeling and evaluation as planned, while acknowledging the limitations of synthetic data.
Next-steps: Design the synthetic dataset to closely mimic real-world complexity; document assumptions and limitations; proceed with model implementation and evaluation pipeline.

2024-06-11 | Documentation | Project goals and initial setup completed | Outcome: Success
Details: Defined project objectives (improving bus arrival-time predictions using supervised learning and multi-source data), outlined methodology, and aligned deliverables with course requirements. Initial project proposal and plan drafted.
Next-steps: Finalize synthetic data schema; begin coding data generation and model training in Jupyter notebook. 

2024-06-11 | Ideation | Brainstormed improvements for bus-gps-data-generator.py | Outcome: Success
Details: Reviewed the reference synthetic data generator provided by the professor. Identified several areas for enhancement to better simulate real-world bus operations and align the dataset with project goals (e.g., context-aware arrival predictions, event/schedule adaptation).
Next-steps: Prioritize improvements, implement changes, and document rationale for each modification.

2024-06-11 | Data-Prep | Designing improved synthetic dataset generator | Outcome: Partial
Details: Started implementing a more realistic bus route and stop modeling system based on the reference code. Adding transit loops with multiple stops, arrival/departure times, dwell times, and passenger boarding/alighting data to better simulate real-world conditions.
Next-steps: Complete implementation of the improved syntheticDataset.py script; add support for route detours and temporary stop closures; test data generation and validate output format.

2024-06-11 | Data-Prep | Implemented enhanced synthetic dataset generator | Outcome: Success
Details: Successfully implemented syntheticDataset.py with significantly improved route and stop modeling features: transit loops with multiple stops, stop-level data (arrivals/departures/dwell times), passenger boarding/alighting, support for route detours, and temporary stop closures.
Next-steps: Run the generator to produce datasets; analyze data quality; use generated data to train and evaluate bus arrival prediction models.

2024-06-11 | Data-Prep | Noted package dependencies | Outcome: Partial
Details: Identified required Python packages for running the synthetic dataset generator: pandas, numpy. These need to be installed before running the script.
Next-steps: Install required dependencies with pip install pandas numpy; run the generator and verify data output.

2024-06-11 | Development | Created Python environment setup script | Outcome: Success
Details: Created a setup_env.sh script to automate environment creation and package installation. Added a project rule to ensure all project code is run with the Python environment activated.
Next-steps: Run the setup script to configure the environment; test the synthetic dataset generator with the environment activated.

2024-06-11 | Data-Prep | Successfully tested synthetic dataset generator | Outcome: Success
Details: Set up the Python environment, resolved a minor bug with departure_time, and successfully generated two datasets: bus_gps_tracking_data.csv (100,000 records, 21MB) and bus_stop_level_data.csv (34,416 records, 6.7MB). The generated data includes realistic transit loops, bus stops, delays, and simulated passenger activity.
Next-steps: Begin exploratory data analysis; set up notebooks for data visualization and model development; start building prediction models based on the synthetic data.

2024-06-11 | Analysis | Verified implementation of all requested features | Outcome: Success
Details: Examined the generated data and confirmed the implementation of: 1) Realistic transit loop modeling with multiple stops, 2) Stop-level data with arrival/departure times and passenger activity, 3) Support for route detours (1.49% of records), 4) Temporal consistency with sequential trip data per bus, 5) Varied weather and traffic conditions maintained through trips.
Next-steps: Enhance the weather and traffic modeling to include more temporal patterns and "weather events" affecting multiple buses simultaneously.

2024-06-11 | Enhancement | Improved weather and traffic modeling | Outcome: Success
Details: Enhanced the synthetic dataset generator with realistic weather events that persist over time periods (2-12 hours) and affect all buses operating during that timeframe. Added 5-15 random weather events throughout the month with appropriate traffic impacts and temperature adjustments based on weather conditions.
Next-steps: Run the updated generator to create an improved dataset; visualize weather patterns and their impact on bus delays/performance; begin developing prediction models that account for these weather events.

2024-06-11 | Data-Prep | Generated enhanced dataset with weather events | Outcome: Success
Details: Successfully generated a new synthetic dataset with 14 weather events that affect multiple buses during the same timeframe. Weather events now show temporal consistency with realistic temperature changes. The new dataset shows more realistic distribution of weather conditions, higher delay probability (24.16% vs previous 20.63%), and improved correlation between weather conditions and traffic patterns.
Next-steps: Begin exploratory data analysis focusing on correlations between weather events and bus delays; develop prediction models that leverage weather patterns; create visualizations showing the impact of weather events on transportation system.

2024-06-11 | Enhancement | Implemented 24/7 bus operations and realistic boarding times | Outcome: Partial
Details: Modifying the synthetic dataset generator to have buses operate 24/7 with reduced passenger counts during night hours. Adding more realistic dwell time calculations where departure times are linearly affected by the number of passengers boarding and alighting at each stop. 
Next-steps: Complete the implementation; generate new dataset with these enhancements; validate that passenger counts follow expected day/night patterns and that dwell times accurately reflect passenger activity.
